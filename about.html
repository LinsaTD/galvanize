                <h2>LONG TERM CORROSION PROTECTION BY HOT DIP GALVANIZING</h2>

            </div>
            <p>Metals tend to get Rust with extensive exposure to weather and hence creating a protective shield is
                critical. The purpose of Galvanizing is to create a protective shield through Zinc coating on steel.
                Hot dip galvanized surfaces are not just protected from severe weather conditions but are able to
                withstand a wide range of mechanical forces too-for decades to come.
